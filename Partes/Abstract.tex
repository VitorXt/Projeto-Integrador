\noindent\chapter*{\uppercase{Abstract}}

In the face of constant technological evolution, the need for very high adaptation was created, because with new technologies comes new knowledge. And based on this, it is clear that there are many lay people in terms of technology, especially in terms of internet access. Consequently, there are many users who are unaware of the danger they are in by naively and insecurely accessing the Web.\\

Thinking about the lack of knowledge in the Technological Age, the activity proposed this semester was to create a BOT, whose main characteristic will be to help the user with or without knowledge about Internet Security. The BOT will objectively be programmed for the user to interact with it, so it will pass on information about ways to protect themselves when accessing and how to deal with some different everyday situations that they find on the internet.
